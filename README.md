==========

This is a Java applet that sends a GAMS formulation describing one of several spatial architecture 
 to a host, and retrieves the result.
 
Uses code described in _A General Constraint-centric Scheduling Framework for Spatial Architectures_,
 a research paper published at PLDI 2013. It also uses examples described in a synthesis chapter (will 
 expand upon description).
