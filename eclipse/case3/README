       Welcome to the ILP Scheduling Interface Guide!

------------------------- Configuration ------------------------

- Before you begin, one important config option is needed : your 
  GAMS executable is probably in a different location than ours.

- Open up the script 'run-gams.sh' for editing. Right at the top, 
  set the environment variable 'GAMS' to point to the path of a 
  valid GAMS executable. 

- Run the script (`./run-gams.sh`), and it will tell you if the
  executable cannot be found.

-------------------------- How to Use -------------------------
  
- Running the scheduler requires two maps as input: a hardware
  graph, and a software graph. Scheduling will link the two.

- The script is your friend - use it to help find what 
  graphs you can use!

 [user@linux.pc] (1)$ ./run-gams

- Running the script without any arguments will print a list of
  the hardware graphs available. 
- They are sorted by architecture, and located in the folder 
  [ARCH]/HW-GRAPH .

 [user@linux.pc] (2)$ ./run-gams -h simple_graph.gms

- Specifying a hardware graph will cause the script to realize
  which architecture you mean (the same name as the encompassing
  folder). It will print a list of the software graphs available.

 [user@linux.pc] (3)$ ./run-gams -h simple_graph.gms -g simpleDAG.gms

- The script will load the graphs, grab the constraints, 
  and invoke GAMS!

--------------------- Understanding Output --------------------
  
  (All files created by GAMS, and referred to here, 
  are in the folder 'work/')

- GAMS loads a master file 'solve.gms', that includes files with all other
  sets, constraints, and variables (both general and arch-specific)
  by absolute paths. 

- When GAMS begins, it will print output to log.txt.
  It will continuously update if GAMS does not terminate immediately.

- When GAMS ends, one of two things can happen:
  1) Compilation fails. We catch this and inform you.
   - Search for the string '****' in 'solve.lst' to find where it failed.
  2) GAMS will complete. 
   - A solution, if found, will be in 'solution.lst'.
   - Check 'solve.lst' to see how GAMS solved the problem.
     This is especially useful in seeing why a solution failed.

-------- How To Add an Architecture in Two Simple Steps -------

- First, add the name of the arch to environment variable 'ARCHS' in the
  configuration options.

- Next, imitate an existing folder heirarchy, using the arch name as the root:
 [user@linux.pc] (3)$ cp -r Simple [ARCH]
